## Innovation in Higher Ed
---
I am focused on creatively applying the best of industry practices and state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques on interesting and high-impact interdisciplinary research. The combination of AI/ML, math/statistics and a diversity of domain expertise provides fresh insights and countless new paths of discovery.

I've also long been interested in bringing diverse voices to urgent debates surrounding technology’s growing impact on society. For most of the last decade I've been developing a humanity-first approach to integrate STEM and non-STEM into a coherent intellectual framework. 

 The organizing principle of both our research and our curriculum is computational Digital Humanities grounded in AI/ML. This approach is designed to bridge the gap between technology and humanity. This integrated worldview will hopefully lead to a more ethical, practical and beneficial use of technology for all.

At Kenyon College, I co-founded the world’s first human-centric AI curriculum. I am sole technical advisor and the primary collaborative content creator. Over the last six years teaching this curriculum, we have achieved the following milestones:

• Produced research in top publications and conferences (Cambridge UP, Narrative, Journal of Cultural Analytics, etc)

• Organically grew (no marketing/PR) to ~15k hits from top universities worldwide (#4 CMU, #5 Berkeley, #6 Stanford, #7 Columbia, #9 NYU, #16 Princeton, #22 Oxford, #23 MIT, #25 Cambridge, etc)

• Diversity: Grew from 18% to 61% Female with URM participation rates often at or above college averages. Our classes are majority non-STEM, reaching out to many students who otherwise feel alienated by traditional CS study.

• Achieved enrollment growth from 20 to 120 becoming one of the largest classes at Kenyon

• Curated a set of fully open-source, best-of-breed tools with no budget required for any software, new hardware or technical support

Our interdisciplinary AI DH research has been published in top presses, journals and conferences. We have also mentored hundreds of ML/AI DH projects that synthesize Artificial Intelligence with literature, history, political science, art, dance, music, law, medicine, economics and more. Various sample AI DH projects are given at the bottom of this page.

<b>Timeline</b>

* **1992-99**: The <a href="https://www.kenyon.edu/academics/departments-and-majors/integrated-program-in-humane-studies/">*Integrated Program for Humane Studies*</a> (IPHS, the oldest interdisciplinary program at Kenyon) established a computer lab in Timberlake House for DH scholarship under Director Michael Brint

> The ***National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Distinguished Teaching Professor** honors a member of Kenyon’s humanities faculty who has displayed excellence in teaching and has developed a ***compelling vision*** of how the professorship would enhance the study of the humanities at the College.  For the purpose of the Professorship, we interpret the "humanities" as broadly as NEH does -- that is, as ***encompassing not only the disciplines in our own Humanities Division but also all other disciplines that examine historical, literary, and philosophical questions about the human condition***.  The professorship is funded by the earnings from an endowment created by a grant from the NEH and gifts from friends of Kenyon. The NEH Professorship is a three year term.

Our AI research and DHColab were collaboratively developed and the cirrculum is currently co-taught by a technology expert (Jon Chun) and an accomplished academic (Katherine Elkins). Both have broad experiences, publications, and interests transcending traditional domain boundaries. Administrative support was provided with a ***3 year National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) appointment*** described here.

>Kate Elkins is developing a Digital Humanities program, an innovative curriculum involving the place of computation and artificial intelligence in the humanities, and a faculty-student research Colab.
