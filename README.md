## Overview

I am an interdisciplinary ML/AI researcher and educator specializing in bridging traditional academic divisions, AI research, industry practices, and emerging social topics including government regulation, ethics, and entrepreneurship. My research focuses on ML/AI approaches to language, narrative, emotion, cognition, and persuasion/deception, employing data science, statistical machine learning, and deep learning including NLP, LLM, and LMM. My work extends to eXplainable AI (XAI), fairness-accuracy-transparency-explainability (FATE), AI ethical auditing, and AI regulation.

As an entrepreneur and innovator, I've contributed to diverse fields from network security and education to finance, insurance, and healthcare across environments ranging from Silicon Valley startups to higher education institutions. I've published pioneering interdisciplinary AI research on storytelling and emotion in major venues including *Narrative* and the Modern Language Association (MLA). In 2016, I co-founded the first human-centered AI curriculum integrating domain experts from literature, music, political science, and economics. We established the term "AI Digital Humanities" and have guided over 300 original ML/AI DH projects as of 2025, achieving approximately 100k downloads (as of January 2026) from leading institutions worldwide. Currently, I serve as a co-principal investigator for the US NIST AI Safety Institute representing the Modern Language Association and collaborate with the IBM-Notre Dame Tech Ethics Lab researching LLM prediction capabilities.

My prior experience includes co-founding the world's largest privacy and anonymity website, backed by In-Q-Tel. As CEO, I led a successful company pivot, co-authored patents on the first browser-based VPN appliance, and navigated the acquisition by Symantec, where I later directed the product's successful relaunch. Previously, I served as CIO for Silicon Valley's premier return-to-work firm and as CTO for international startups in Latin America and Japan. During medical school, I was an American Heart Association research fellow, publishing on gene therapy and pioneering web-based EMR systems in the American Medical Informatics Journal. My early career included roles as DELL's first US-based Japanese localization engineer, SEMATECH's initial Japanese patent analyst, and positions in Tokyo financial reporting, Lawrence Berkeley Labs' synchrotron facility (ALS), and Computer Associates' aerospace IT division.

**Languages:** English (native), Spanish (US Foreign Service Exam certified), Japanese (JLPT certified), French (professional working proficiency)

**Professional interests:** AI advancement, collaborative innovation, creative engineering, functional design, technical presentations, and enterprise solutions. Previous leadership experience includes coaching roles in baseball, soccer, wrestling, robotics, and Destination Imagination.

**["Archival Intelligence: Can AI Rescue Endangered Archives"](https://www.schmidtsciences.org/humanities-and-ai-virtual-institute/)**

*Schmidt Sciences Humanities and AI Virtual Institute (Co-PI on 1 of 23 Schmidt Sciences HAVI grants given to leading AI Research Teams worldwide)*  
**Began:** January 2026

Small archives hold one-of-a-kind historical materials that exist nowhere else. Those paying attention, however, are watching them disappear. Wealthy institutions can afford professional preservation, but small community archives cannot, and the impact is very real. Descendants are losing connection to their ancestors' stories, and communities are being severed from their own heritage. Even historians cannot tell complete stories, because primary sources are crumbling and in some cases, vanishing forever. A 1919 New Orleans newspaper (right) grows less readable each year, with the only remaining photo leaving a damaged, wrinkled corner in shadow. Small historical societies know what they're losing, but professional preservation equipment and archivists are too costly to be within reach.

A team of AI researchers, archival scientists, jazz historians, and New Orleans cultural experts is racing to stop this loss. The goal? Preservation using only a smartphone photo, with AI to recover portions lost to damage. The team is also building AI intelligence into recovered materials, connecting information across documents, languages, and formats so researchers and descendants can find what they're looking for and even facilitate new discoveries. This 18-month New Orleans pilot tackles the hardest cases by focusing on voices systematically excluded from historical archives: multilingual newspapers documenting Creole and Cajun communities as well as early jazz materials. If it works, thousands of small archives will finally have a way to save what's disappearing.

#### ["Syntactic Framing Fragility: An Audit of Robustness in LLM Ethical Decisions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09724)

*ArXiv Preprint (December 27, 2025)*

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making settings, yet their robustness to benign prompt variation remains underexplored. In this work, we study whether LLMs maintain consistent ethical judgments across logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, focusing on variations involving negation and conditional structure. We introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF), a robustness evaluation framework that isolates purely syntactic effects via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN), enabling direct comparison of decisions across positive and negative framings without semantic drift. Auditing 23 state-of-the-art models spanning the U.S. and China as well as small U.S. open-source software models over 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), we find widespread and statistically significant inconsistency: many models reverse ethical endorsements solely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models exhibiting over twice the fragility of commercial counterparts. We further uncover extreme negation sensitivity, where some models endorse actions in 80-97% of cases when explicitly prompted with "should not." We show that eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning substantially reduces fragility, identifying a practical mitigation lever, and we map fragility across scenarios, finding higher risk in financial and business contexts than in medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that syntactic consistency constitutes a distinct and critical dimension of ethical robustness, and we argue that SFF-style audits should be a standard component of safety evaluation for deployed LLMs. Code and results will be available on this URL.

#### ["AgenticSimLaw: A Juvenile Courtroom Multi-Agent Debate Simulation for Explainable High-Stakes Tabular Decision Making"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=92kj14Wa8z)

*Accepted: AAAI-26 LaMAS (Singapore, January 2026)*  
*[IBM-Notre Dame Tech Ethics Lab Grant](https://techethicslab.nd.edu/call-for-proposals/)*

We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains. Data, results, and code will be available on github.com under the MIT license.

#### "ESP-Ethical Audit: An Ethical Alignment Audit to Quantify Biased Decision-Making with Emotion and Syntactic Framing"

*(In Review)*

Autonomous agents and distributed AI networks are beginning to assist and even make decisions in real-world scenarios ranging from smart cities to HR. Ethical assessments are more urgent than ever, and our framework, ESP-Ethical Audit, offers a novel way to assess both strengths and vulnerabilities in current LLM systems. To date, there is surprisingly little quantitative assessment of underlying "ethical belief" systems in LLMs. This type of assessment samples the distribution of a binary classification task when LLMs are presented with complex and ethically-fraught scenarios. We interrogate whether decision-making by leading commercial and open-source LLM models align with human values and if so, whether that alignment reveals biases that typically occur in human decision-making. ESP-Ethical Audit measures confidence levels and explanatory frameworks across a variety of moral scenarios while testing perturbations along two dimensions: syntactic framing and empathic backstory. The former tests whether syntactic framing surfaces biases that mirror common framing biases documented in humans. The latter tests variations in backstory—both positive and negative—within two different relevancy scenarios. The first framework tests the introduction of facts that might be considered allowable in a US court of law; the other tests backstories that rely on emotional appeal. In all three framing cases, whether syntactic or backstory, we find more performant models more closely mirror human biases and exhibit common shifts in decision-making. Our audit raises important safety concerns: continued AI progress in both performance and human-machine value alignment may also increase security issues related to persuasion, manipulation, and deception.

#### ["Comparative Global AI Regulation: Policy Perspectives from the EU, China, and the US"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21279)

*SSRN and ArXiv*

As a powerful and rapidly advancing dual-use technology, AI offers both immense benefits and worrisome risks. In response, governing bodies around the world are developing a range of regulatory AI laws and policies. This paper compares three distinct approaches taken by the EU, China and the US. Within the US, we explore AI regulation at both the federal and state level, with a focus on California's pending Senate Bill 1047. Each regulatory system reflects distinct cultural, political and economic perspectives. Each also highlights differing regional perspectives on regulatory risk-benefit tradeoffs, with divergent judgments on the balance between safety versus innovation and cooperation versus competition. Finally, differences between regulatory frameworks reflect contrastive stances in regards to trust in centralized authority versus trust in a more decentralized free market of self-interested stakeholders. Taken together, these varied approaches to AI innovation and regulation influence each other, the broader international community, and the future of AI regulation.

#### ["AIStorySimilarity: Quantifying Story Similarity Using Narrative for Search, IP Infringement, and Guided Creativity"](https://aclanthology.org/2024.conll-1.13/)

*ACL EMNLP/CoNLL, Miami (November 12-16, 2024)*

Stories are central for interpreting experiences, communicating and influencing each other via films, medical, media, and other narratives. Quantifying the similarity between stories has numerous applications including detecting IP infringement, detecting hallucinations, search/recommendation engines, and guiding human-AI collaborations. Despite this, traditional NLP text similarity metrics are limited to short text distance metrics like n-gram overlaps and embeddings. Larger texts require preprocessing with significant information loss through paraphrasing or multi-step decomposition. This paper introduces AIStorySimilarity, a novel benchmark to measure the semantic distance between long-text stories based on core structural elements drawn from narrative theory and script writing. Based on four narrative elements (characters, plot, setting, and themes) as well 31 sub-features within these, we use a SOTA LLM (gpt-3.5-turbo) to extract and evaluate the semantic similarity of a diverse set of major Hollywood movies. In addition, we compare human evaluation with story similarity scores computed three ways: extracting elements from film scripts before evaluation (Elements), directly evaluating entire scripts (Scripts), and extracting narrative elements from the parametric memory of SOTA LLMs without any provided scripts (GenAI). To the best of our knowledge, AIStorySimilarity is the first benchmark to measure long-text story similarity using a comprehensive approach to narrative theory. Code and data are available at https://github.com/jon-chun/AIStorySimilarity.

*Frontiers in Computer Science*

Affective artificial intelligence and multimodal sentiment analysis play critical roles in designing safe and effective human-computer interactions and are in diverse applications ranging from social chatbots to eldercare robots. However emotionally intelligent artificial intelligence can also manipulate, persuade, and otherwise compromise human autonomy. We face a constant stream of ever more capable models that can better understand nuanced, complex, and interrelated sentiments across different modalities including text, vision, and speech. This paper introduces MultiSentimentArcs, a combination of an open and extensible multimodal sentiment analysis framework, a challenging movie dataset, and a novel benchmark. This enables the quantitative and qualitative identification, comparison, and prioritization of conflicting sentiments commonly arising from different models and modalities. Diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis is especially challenging in film narratives where actors, directors, cinematographers and editors use dialog, characters, and other elements in contradiction with each other to accentuate dramatic tension. MultiSentimentArcs uses local open-source software models to democratize artificial intelligence. We demonstrate how a simple 2-step pipeline of specialized open-source software with a large multimodal model followed by a large language model can approximate video sentiment analysis of a commercial state-of-the-art Claude 3 Opus. To the best of our knowledge, MultiSentimentArcs is the first fully open-source diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis framework, dataset, and benchmark to enable automatic or human-in-the-loop exploration, analysis, and critique of multimodal sentiment analysis on long-form narratives. We demonstrate two novel coherence metrics and a methodology to identify, quantify, and explain real-world sentiment models and modalities. MultiSentimentArcs integrates artificial intelligence with traditional narrative studies and related fields like film, linguistic and cultural studies. It also contributes to eXplainable artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence safety by enhancing artificial intelligence transparency in surfacing emotional persuasion, manipulation, and deception techniques. Finally, it can filter noisy emotional input and prioritize information rich channels to build more performant real-world human computer interface applications in fields like e-learning and medicine. This research contributes to the field of interdisciplinary human-centered AI by giving non-artificial intelligence experts access to directly engage in analysis and critique of research around affective artificial intelligence and human-AI alignment.

#### ["In search of a translator: using AI to evaluate what's lost in translation"](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computer-science/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2024.1444021/full)

*Frontiers in Computer Science, August 12, 2024, Sec. Human-Media Interaction, Volume 6 - 2024*

Machine translation metrics often fall short in capturing the challenges of literary translation in which translators play a creative role. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT4o and Mistral offer new approaches to assessing how well a translation mirrors the reading experience from one language to another. Our case study focuses on the first volume of Marcel Proust's "A la recherche du temps perdu," a work known for its lively translation debates. We use stylometry and emotional arc leveraging the newest multilingual generative AI models to evaluate loss in translation according to different translation theories. AI analysis reveals previously undertheorized aspects of translation. Notably, we uncover changes in authorial style and the evolution of sentiment language over time. Our study demonstrates that AI-driven approaches leveraging advanced LLMs yield new perspectives on literary translation assessment. These methods offer insight into the creative choices made by translators and open up new avenues for understanding the complexities of translating literary works.

#### ["Near to Mid-term Risks and Opportunities of Open-Source Generative AI"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17047)

*ICML 2024, May 7-11, Vienna, Austria*

**["Risks and Opportunities of Open-Source Generative AI"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08597)** (Long form version)

In the next few years, applications of Generative AI are expected to revolutionize a number of different areas, ranging from science & medicine to education. The potential for these seismic changes has triggered a lively debate about potential risks and resulted in calls for tighter regulation, in particular from some of the major tech companies who are leading in AI development. This regulation is likely to put at risk the budding field of open source Generative AI. We argue for the responsible open sourcing of generative AI models in the near and medium term. To set the stage, we first introduce an AI openness taxonomy system and apply it to 40 current large language models. We then outline differential benefits and risks of open versus closed source AI and present potential risk mitigation, ranging from best practices to calls for technical and scientific contributions. We hope that this report will add a much needed missing voice to the current public discourse on near to mid-term AI safety and other societal impact.

#### ["Informed AI Regulation: Comparing the Ethical Frameworks of Leading LLM Chatbots Using an Ethics-Based Audit to Assess Moral Reasoning and Normative Values"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01651)

*ArXiv.org (January 9, 2024)*

With the rise of individual and collaborative networks of autonomous agents, AI is deployed in more key reasoning and decision-making roles. For this reason, ethics-based audits play a pivotal role in the rapidly growing fields of AI safety and regulation. This paper undertakes an ethics-based audit to probe the 8 leading commercial and open-source Large Language Models including GPT-4. We assess explicability and trustworthiness by a) establishing how well different models engage in moral reasoning and b) comparing normative values underlying models as ethical frameworks. We employ an experimental, evidence-based approach that challenges the models with ethical dilemmas in order to probe human-AI alignment. The ethical scenarios are designed to require a decision in which the particulars of the situation may or may not necessitate deviating from normative ethical principles. A sophisticated ethical framework was consistently elicited in one model, GPT-4. Nonetheless, troubling findings include underlying normative frameworks with clear bias towards particular cultural norms. Many models also exhibit disturbing authoritarian tendencies. Code is available at https://github.com/jon-chun/llm-sota-chatbots-ethics-based-audit.

*Springer International Journal of Digital Humanities 5, 507–532 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s42803-023-00069-8 (October 11, 2023)*

The recent development of Transformers and large language models (LLMs) offer unique opportunities to work with natural language. They bring a degree of understanding and fluidity far surpassing previous language models, and they are rapidly progressing. They excel at representing and interpreting ideas and experiences that involve complex and subtle language and are therefore ideal for interdisciplinary human-centered AI research. This paper briefly surveys how XAI can be used to augment two interdisciplinary human-centered AI research areas relying on LLMs: (a) diachronic text sentiment analysis and (b) narrative generation. We also introduce a novel XAI greybox ensemble for diachronic sentiment analysis generalizable to any AI classification data points within a structured time series. Under human-in-the-loop supervision (HITL), this greybox ensemble combines the high performance of SOTA blackbox models like gpt-4-0613 with the interpretability, efficiency, and privacy-preserving nature of whitebox models. Two new local (EPC) and global (ECC) metrics enable multi-scale XAI at both the local and global levels. This greybox ensemble framework extends the SentimentArcs framework with OpenAI's latest GPT models, new metrics and a modified supervisory HITL workflow released as open source software at https://github.com/jon-chun/SentimentArcs-Greybox.

*International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing*

This article outlines what a successful interdisciplinary human-centered artificial intelligence curriculum entails and why it is so critical now. Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping our world and is poised to exacerbate long-standing crises including (1) the crisis of higher education and the humanities, (2) the lack of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in computer science and technology fields and (3) the wider social and economic crises facilitated by new technologies. We outline a number of ways in which an AI DH curriculum offers concrete and impactful responses to these many crises. AI DH yields meaningful new avenues of research for the humanities and the humanistic social sciences, and offers new ways that higher education can better prepare students for the world into which they graduate. DEI metrics show how an AI DH curriculum can engage students traditionally underserved by conventional STEM courses. Finally, AI DH educates all students for civic engagement in order to address both the social and economic impacts of emerging AI technologies. This article provides an overview of an AI DH curriculum, the motivating theory behind design decisions, and a detailed look into two sample courses.

*ArXiv abs/2110.09454 (2021): n. page.*

SOTA Transformer and DNN short text sentiment classifiers report over 97% accuracy on narrow domains like IMDB movie reviews. Real-world performance is significantly lower because traditional models overfit benchmarks and generalize poorly to different or more open domain texts. This paper introduces SentimentArcs, a new self-supervised time series sentiment analysis methodology that addresses the two main limitations of traditional supervised sentiment analysis: limited labeled training datasets and poor generalization. A large ensemble of diverse models provides a synthetic ground truth for self-supervised learning. Novel metrics jointly optimize an exhaustive search across every possible corpus:model combination. The joint optimization over both the corpus and model solves the generalization problem. Simple visualizations exploit the temporal structure in narratives so domain experts can quickly spot trends, identify key features, and note anomalies over hundreds of arcs and millions of data points. To our knowledge, this is the first self-supervised method for time series sentiment analysis and the largest survey directly comparing real-world model performance on long-form narratives.

*Journal of Cultural Analytics 5, no. 2 (2020): 17212.*

Until recently the field of natural language generation relied upon formalized grammar systems, small-scale statistical models, and lengthy sets of heuristic rules. This older technology was fairly limited and brittle: it could remix language into word salad poems or chat with humans within narrowly defined topics. Recently, very large-scale statistical language models have dramatically advanced the field, and GPT-3 is just one example. It can internalize the rules of language without explicit programming or rules. Instead, much like a human child, GPT-3 learns language through repeated exposure, albeit on a much larger scale. Without explicit rules, it can sometimes fail at the simplest of linguistic tasks, but it can also excel at more difficult ones like imitating an author or waxing philosophical.

Sentiment analysis has gained widespread adoption in many fields, but not—until now—in literary studies. Scholars have lacked a robust methodology that adapts the tool to the skills and questions central to literary scholars. Also lacking has been quantitative data to help the scholar choose between the many models. Which model is best for which narrative, and why? By comparing over three dozen models, including the latest Deep Learning AI, the author details how to choose the correct model—or set of models—depending on the unique affective fingerprint of a narrative. The author also demonstrates how to combine a clustered close reading of textual cruxes in order to interpret a narrative. By analyzing a diverse and cross-cultural range of texts in a series of case studies, the Element highlights new insights into the many shapes of stories.

## Innovation in Higher Ed

I creatively apply industry best practices and state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques to high-impact interdisciplinary research. The combination of AI/ML, mathematics/statistics, and diverse domain expertise provides fresh insights and creates new paths of discovery. Our paper [The Crisis of Artificial Intelligence: A New Digital Humanities Curriculum for Human-Centred AI](https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/full/10.3366/ijhac.2023.0310?journalCode=ijhac), published in the International Journal of Humanities and Computing, outlines the challenges and opportunities AI presents to higher education, as well as the theory, structure, and goals of our human-centered AI approach that we hope can become a model for other institutions.

Our human-centered curriculum is designed to be collaborative at multiple levels and interdisciplinary while maintaining academic rigor. Students from virtually every department across campus create a unique classroom learning and research environment. Research from our AI Colab has contributed to numerous collaborative projects with institutions including Oxford, UC Berkeley, CMU, and Harvard Business School, with co-authors from departments spanning Computer Science, AI, Mathematics, Physics, Economics, and MBA programs. We focus on productive collaborations to operationalize solutions to the "big questions" central to the Liberal Arts experience. This includes partnerships with industry leaders (Meta, IBM), government agencies (NIST AI Safety Institute), and non-profits (AI Alliance, The Modern Language Association, US Chamber of Commerce, The Helix Center). Recent projects have addressed international AI regulation, researched ethical frameworks inherent in AI models, and reimagined education and skills development for an AI-integrated workforce ([Guide to Essential Competencies for AI](https://thealliance.ai/core-projects/guide-to-essential-competencies-for-ai)).

I am committed to bringing diverse voices to urgent debates surrounding technology's societal impact. Our interdisciplinary human-centered AI computing curriculum has successfully attracted a majority female enrollment (61%), non-STEM majors (91%), and historically underrepresented minorities (11% Hispanic, 13% Black) as of 2022. The program has grown to become one of the most popular courses on campus, with both faculty and student research generating significant academic impact through citations and institutional engagement worldwide.

Over the past decade, I have developed a human-first approach to teaching computation grounded in ML, AI, and Data Science, with real-world applications inseparable from ethics. This required bridging the [C.P. Snow STEM and non-STEM divide](https://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/snow_1959.pdf), harmonizing academic specialization with practical interdisciplinary solutions, and building a new interdisciplinary human-centered AI computing curriculum without any additional institutional budget, headcount, or support resources.

In its first six years, our foundational course has become one of the most popular on campus. Faculty and student research has been published in leading journals and presented at major conferences, reaching tens of thousands of readers from prestigious universities and research centers globally. Both program founders have engaged with multiple organizations beyond our institution dedicated to AI ethics and CS education innovation.

My philosophical goal is to cultivate in students a technologically informed worldview grounded in universal humanistic values. It is imperative to equip all students, especially those underserved by traditional CS/AI programs, with a sound intellectual framework that synthesizes both sides of the C.P. Snow divide for both the individual and society at large.

*Progress on Gender Diversity in interdisciplinary human-centered AI curriculum since the 2017-2018 academic year (61% female as of Spring 2022)*

At Kenyon College, I co-founded the world's first human-centered AI curriculum. I am the sole technical advisor and the primary collaborative content creator. Over the last six years of teaching this curriculum, we have achieved the following milestones:

**Research:** Published research in top publications and conferences (Cambridge UP, Narrative, Journal of Cultural Analytics, etc.) with clear growth in citations.

**Interdisciplinary Human-Centered AI Colab Research:** Organically grew (no marketing/PR) to ~15k hits from top universities worldwide (#4 CMU, #5 Berkeley, #6 Stanford, #7 Columbia, #9 NYU, #16 Princeton, #22 Oxford, #23 MIT, #25 Cambridge, etc.)

**Diversity:**
- **Female:** Grew from 18% to 61% between 2017-2021
- **Hispanic:** participation rates are often at or above college averages
- **Black:** 13% (Fall 2022 estimate above)
- **Non-STEM:** Our classes are ~90% non-STEM from across nearly all departments, enfranchising many students who may otherwise feel alienated by traditional CS programs
- **100%** Pass rate (Quality of student work independently confirmed by success of their research archive at digital.kenyon.edu/dh)
- **0%** Drop rate

**Enrollment:** Experienced enrollment growth from 20 to 120 between 2017-2022 becoming one of the largest classes at Kenyon as an elective with no credit toward the traditional STEM computing major/minor

**Budget:** With no budget or antecedent, innovated from scratch a globally recognized interdisciplinary AI Colab research center and human-centered AI program. This includes no funds for hardware, software, cloud computing, support staff or other common expenses. This is achieved through continual strategic planning, careful curation and testing fully open-source, robust, best-of-breed and/or freely available resources informed by decades of experience in industry.

Our interdisciplinary AI DH research has been published in top presses, journals, and conferences. We have also mentored hundreds of ML/AI DH projects that synthesize Artificial Intelligence with literature, history, political science, art, dance, music, law, medicine, economics and more. Various sample AI DH projects are given at the bottom of this page.

### [IPHS 300 AI for the Humanities](https://digital.kenyon.edu/dh_iphs_ai/) (Introduced 2019)

"Why isn't AI a branch of mathematics?" Norvig and Russell ask in their seminal textbook *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*. "The first answer," they explain, "is that AI from the start embraced the idea of duplicating human faculties such as creativity, self-improvement, and language use" (18).

We explore AI from this humanist perspective by building a foundation to understand the creativity, self-improvement and language at the core of the discipline. Our approach blends the conceptual with hands-on exploration and application. We think through the humanist-centered theory and practice of artificial intelligence and machine learning from a liberal arts perspective that is highly interdisciplinary in nature. To that end, the course will touch on domains intertwined with AI like cognitive science and language and linguistics.

Textual analysis will receive our major attention and will provide an ideal foundation for students interested in computational approaches to literature. However we will also explore a wide range of textual applications that will be of interest to a broader range of students: textual analytics that help us explore disciplines like economics, politics, sociology, cultural studies, and psychology. The last weeks of the course will move to image, video and sound by building on previous skills acquired from textual analysis.

**Overview:**

This upper-division course offers an in-depth exploration of advanced AI concepts, focusing on interdisciplinary applications of large language models, AI information systems, and autonomous agents. Over 15 weeks, students will engage with a progressive curriculum, starting with a review of Python and a series of four hands-on projects: (a) OpenAI API programming a GPT-based chatbot, (b) mechanistic interpretations of transformer internals using Huggingface Transformers, (c) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain, and (d) simulations of autonomous multi-agent systems using AutoGen. The course includes four substantive subprojects and one final project, enabling students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical, real-world AI challenges. This course is designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to innovate in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, emphasizing both technical proficiency and ethical considerations. Introductory Python programming experience required.

**Note:** These 4 broad frontiers of AI research are rapidly evolving and based upon my AI research and industry consulting with Meta, IBM, the Whitehouse/NIST AI Safety Institute, etc. There is a constant flow of major new AI research, libraries, frameworks and startups nearly every week. Since this course will begin 9 months after this syllabus was written, expect updates to reflect the most recent in AI research breakthroughs, tooling, and industry best practices as of August 2024. Nonetheless, the class will be structured around these 4 broad and relatively consistent universal areas in AI.

### [The Helix Center](https://www.helixcenter.org/), New York, NY

**Executive Committee** (2022-)

**Round-Table:** [Living in Difficult Times](https://www.helixcenter.org/participants/jon-chun/), November 19, 2022

**About:** The original inspiration for interdisciplinary forums arose from the observations by our director, Dr. Edward Nersessian, of the constraints in both communication and creativity among scientists at professional meetings, fueled both by narrow specialization and the grant process, that with its demand for sharply defined investigation seemed, in fact, to be limiting curiosity and inquiry. This motivated him to form discussion groups drawing on multiple disciplines, the creative productivity of which inspired the formation of the Philoctetes Center for the Multidisciplinary Study of the Imagination.

**Mission:** The primary mission of The Helix Center is to draw together leaders from distinct spheres of knowledge in the arts, humanities, sciences, and technology for interdisciplinary roundtables, the unique format of which potentiates new ideas, new questions, and facilitates emergent creative qualities of mind less possible in conventional collaborations. Such a drawing together of leaders of various disciplines irrespective of their academic affiliation allows the Helix Center to function as a kind of university without walls. In addition, through audience attendance and its Q&A engagement with the roundtable participants, and live streamed and archived events, we aim to expand public understanding and appreciation of the sciences and technology, the arts and humanities.
